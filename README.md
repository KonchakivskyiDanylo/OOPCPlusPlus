# NaUKMA C++ OOP Course Repository

## Overview
This repository contains my implementations for the C++ Object-Oriented Programming course at the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy (NaUKMA). The course explores fundamental and advanced OOP concepts through practical programming assignments, each focusing on different aspects of C++ and object-oriented design.

## Course Projects

### Project 1: Triangle Median Project (9/10)

### Project 2: Complex Numbers (9/10)

### Project 3: Custom String Class (TBD)

### Project 4: Unbounded Sequence (9.8/10)

### Project 5: Abstract Queue Implementations (TBD)

## Technologies & Concepts
- C++ (C++11/14/17)
- Object-Oriented Programming principles
- Templates and Generic Programming
- Memory management and efficiency optimization
- Class hierarchies and inheritance
- Operator overloading
- Move semantics
- Type conversions

## Learning Outcomes
Through these projects, I've developed a deeper understanding of:
- Practical OOP design patterns and their application
- Memory management techniques in C++
- Effective use of C++ standard library components
- Performance considerations in software design
- Type system mechanics and conversions

## Contact
Feel free to reach out with questions or suggestions about any of these implementations!
