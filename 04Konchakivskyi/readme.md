# C++ OOP Fourth Project - NaUKMA
This repository contains my fourth project for the C++ Object-Oriented Programming course at the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy (NaUKMA).

## Task Description
Implement a parameterized class for unbounded sequences based on an array. The sequence operations should include:
1. Creating an empty sequence
2. Adding an element to the sequence
3. Removing a specified element from the sequence
4. Checking if an element belongs to the sequence

## Implementation
This repository contains the implementation of a template-based unbounded sequence class using dynamic arrays, following object-oriented programming principles and best practices in C++. The implementation focuses on dynamic memory management, efficient operations, and type safety through templates.

## Project Structure
- `Sequence<T>` class - templated implementation of an unbounded sequence
- Memory management utilities
- Element operations (add, remove, search)
- Iterators for sequence traversal
- Test cases demonstrating functionality

## Current Evaluation: 9.8/10
