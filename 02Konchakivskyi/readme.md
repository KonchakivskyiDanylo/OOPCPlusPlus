# C++ OOP Second Project - NaUKMA
This repository contains my second project for the C++ Object-Oriented Programming course at the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy (NaUKMA).

## Task Description
1. Implement two variants of complex number classes:
   - `AComplex` - complex numbers in algebraic form (a + bi)
   - `TComplex` - complex numbers in trigonometric form (r∠θ)
2. Define and implement additive operations in algebraic form, and multiplicative operations in trigonometric form. Consider implementing compound assignment operators.
3. Test the implemented classes, tracking object creation and type conversions, particularly when applying arithmetic operations to expressions of mixed types, using real numbers, complex numbers in algebraic form, or complex numbers in trigonometric form as operation arguments.

## Implementation
This repository contains the implementation of two complex number classes with different representations, following object-oriented programming principles and best practices in C++. The implementation focuses on proper handling of arithmetic operations between different number types and efficient type conversions when necessary.

## Project Structure
- `AComplex` class - complex numbers in algebraic form (a + bi)
- `TComplex` class - complex numbers in trigonometric form (r∠θ)
- Conversion utilities between different representations
- Arithmetic operations implementation
- Test suite for validating correct behavior

## Current Evaluation: 9/10
