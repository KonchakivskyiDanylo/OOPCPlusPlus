# C++ OOP Third Project - NaUKMA
This repository contains my third project for the C++ Object-Oriented Programming course at the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy (NaUKMA).

## Task Description
1. Define and implement a custom string class `String`:
   - Constructor from C-string and STL string
   - Copy constructor and assignment operator
   - Move constructor and assignment operator
   - Compound assignment operator
   - Subscript operator `[]`
   - Addition operator `+`
   - Equality operators `==` and `!=`
2. Ensure the ability to perform type conversions and mixed operations between custom strings, C-strings, and STL strings. For example, given `String s1; string s2; char* p`, implement operations like:
   - `s1+s2`
   - `s2+s1`
   - `p+s1`
   - `s1+p`
   - Conversion of `s1` to C-string, etc.

## Implementation
This repository contains the implementation of a custom string class with support for various operations and conversions, following object-oriented programming principles and best practices in C++. The implementation focuses on proper memory management, efficient operations, and seamless interoperability with standard string types.

## Project Structure
- `String` class - custom string implementation
- Conversion utilities between string types
- Operators for mixed-type operations
- Test cases demonstrating functionality

## Current Evaluation: TBD (Not yet evaluated)
